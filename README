This plugin expects you to supply an SVG or SVGZ file as the
src of an image. The script will only work if you omit the height or 
width from the image in order to detect whether or not it rendered
properly. Usage is simple - for instance to run this method on
any svg images embedded in the page you can use:

$(window).load(function () {
  $("img[src$='.svg'], img[src$='.svgz']").svgimg();
});

I recommend $(window).load() over $(document).ready()
to ensure that supporting browsers were able to render the 
graphic before attempting to replace it with an object.

For handling browsers that do not support SVG graphics
in general - I recommend utilizing a tool such as
Modernizr to detect and handle a lack of SVG support.
